        // Write your JavaScript code here

        //Variable Declaration
        const x = 2;
        let y = "hi";
        let z = true;
        console.log(x, y, z);
        //let y = 3;
        // x = false;
        // console.log(x, y, z);
        // trying to change a declared variable with "let" results in an error
        // as its in the same scope... 
        // trying to change const variable also results in error as its a constant unchangeable variable


        //String Operations
        string1 = "Hello, World!"
        string2 = "JavaScript is fun!"
        console.log('length of string1 is: ${string1.length}');
